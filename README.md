# Predicting the amount tipped using a variety of qualitative factors
This repo contains source code that can be used to predict the amount tipped in a New York Yellow taxi trip.The purpose of this analysis is to predict the amount tipped in a taxi ride based on a variety of quantitative factors. Some of these factors include the length of the trip, time of day, number of passengers, and the inclusion of other surcharges. To conduct this analysis, we are using Trip Data collected by the New York City Taxi & Limousine comission(TLC) for the month of May 2019. We employ a linear regression model that is trained on this data and then predicted on a test-set that was generated from the same month. There are three main folders: inputs, output, and scripts. There are README files in each of them to guide you along the way.

This folder contains the scripts required to do this analysis. There are two files:

1) 01_cleaning_data.R- Run this file to produce a cleaned version of the raw data
2) 02_modelling.R- Run this file to create the model

Outputs of both these scripts are stored in the output folder under data and model respectively.
